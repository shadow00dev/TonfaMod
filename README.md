# Shadows Tonfa
This is my first minecraft mod, its a pretty small mod that adds a bunch of tonfas.

The tonfas can block if the tonfa is in the off hand and when you punch it will switch the "state" of the tonfa to its flipped or unflipped version basically, right now this is purely visual.

I used [geckolib 5](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib) to make the tonfa switching animated

The mod is currently for 1.21.10 and uses neoforge
